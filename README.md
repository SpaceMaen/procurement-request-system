# \# Procurement Request System

# 

# This project aims to create and organize formal procurement requests

# for products and services within an organization.

# 

# \## Problem

# Employees often lack a structured way to request products or services.

# Requests are incomplete, inconsistent, or hard to track.

# 

# \## Solution

# A structured request system where users can:

# \- Create procurement requests

# \- Submit them to the procurement department

# \- Track status changes throughout the process

# 

# \## Core Features (MVP)

# \- Create and edit requests (Draft)

# \- Submit requests

# \- Review and process requests (Procurement)

# \- Status workflow (Submitted, In Review, Approved, Rejected, Closed)

# 

# \## Status

# Early concept / initial project structure.
